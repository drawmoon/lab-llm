# 🧪 Lab-LLM

> A collection of experiments, integrations, and practical examples for working with modern Large Language Model (LLM) frameworks — including LangChain, LangFlow, LangGraph, LangExtract, and more.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Lab-LLM** is a hands-on workspace for exploring the ecosystem of LLM tools.  
It includes tutorials, examples, and integrations demonstrating how to build intelligent workflows, chains, and agents with state-of-the-art frameworks.

Whether you're experimenting with prompt engineering, flow orchestration, or data extraction — this lab is designed to help you **learn, compare, and prototype quickly**.
